# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion**

Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer  
B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)
[Experience/Languages][0]

1. I code with an enterprise standards in mindset, I think it's insane not having code-reviews
2. I am comfortable in Windows, MacOSX and Linux (specific distros: Redhat/Ubuntu)
3. I do **not **re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e. time/space complexity)
4. Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better
5. I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available to my advantage, I spend the time planning/designing first to save time later**Above all**I am fortunate that I have a supportive, amazing girlfriend who puts up with the ridiculous amount of LED's I have, and coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to develop software that will improve quality of life for those in need, and to give back more than ever.
