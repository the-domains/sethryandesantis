# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion**

Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer  
B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)

Improving every day, fortunate that my father is a prodigy (he won't admit, but I've heard it all my life from his co-workers) and I continue to learn how to approach code, and it has propelled me far ahead of where I thought I'd be at this point.

1. I am comfortable in Windows, MacOSX and Linux (specific distros: Redhat/Ubuntu)
2. I do **not **re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e. time/space complexity)
3. Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better
4. I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available to my advantage, I spend the time planning/designing first to save time later

## **Above all**

I am fortunate that I have a supportive, amazing girlfriend who puts up with the ridiculous amount of LED's I have, and coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to develop software that will improve quality of life for those in need, and to give back more than ever.
