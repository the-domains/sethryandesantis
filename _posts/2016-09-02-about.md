# Code Life

### Currently:

I decided I can make a much bigger impact doing my own thing, ultimately, rather than other services, we give the **large **majority to the artist. They deserve it, and musicians will realize that. This is a very special project launching hopefully December, but I rather do it right, **nothing **like this exists.

* Full-Stack Developer \[MEAN\] / Founder @ _[ThinkFirst LLC][0]_

---

### Education:

* B.S. Computer Science, Chapman University (2016)

---

### Action Items:

* Self-motivated/driven/taught and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better
* I inherited and continue to 40 years of knowledge, which has ultimately led to me approaching code the opposite of what the teach, 
* I work with the hardware, not against it - (i.e., CPU Cache Lines, when working with lower level software)
* I do not re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e., time/space complexity)
* I am comfortable in Windows, MacOSX, and Linux (specific distros: Redhat/Ubuntu)
* I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available to my advantage. 
* I spend the time planning/designing first to save time later.

## **Personal Life**

I have a genuinely astounding girlfriend, who recognizes and supports my enthusiasm for coding and technology. 

Providing opportunities and giving back is far more rewarding than any paycheck, and ultimately scaling this up is a milestone

She inspires me in a lot of ways to use my passion to assist others to continue theirs and give back as much as possible.

Always have music playing, avid snowboarder - Lake Tahoe will always be my second home. Squaw season pass holder, if not coding you'll find me there during the season.

I watch a lot of hockey, I also code a lot.
