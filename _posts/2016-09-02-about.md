# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion**

Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer  
B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)

1. I code with an enterprise standards in mindset no matter what the project
2. I'm used to working on large code-bases 
3. I do **not **re-invent, I extend off what is available and build off unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e. time/space complexity)
4. Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better
5. I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available and avoid the grunt work and focus more on the overall design and structure
6. I gravitate towards leadership and enjoy helping others
7. If I disagree with development decisions being made I will not sit-back, I will provide why I disagree, and alternative approach. 
8. I am always willing to help others - but I will only guide them to a solution (i.e.) I will not absorb their workload unless I am absorbing their pay as well

**The non-coding part of me**

Huge fan of electronic music, and closely linked to the industry.   
Love LED's, especially Philips HUE.  
I enjoy fishing, but rarely catch anything.  
Strong love for animals, especially dogs.  
**Above all**  
I am fortunate that I have a supportive, amazing girlfriend who puts up with the ridiculous amount of LED's I have, and coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to develop software that will improve quality of life for those in need, and to give back more than ever.
