Key takeaway:

* Don't buy giant glass case with no bottom or back panel
* Thermaltake sells WC'd heatsink for CPU that has cords do not fit properly, not offer a longer cabled version. Fans show be against side panel.
* The case structure is cheap, taking the side panel off always is a pain. 
* Stick to non thermal-take products, PSU driver is horrid.
