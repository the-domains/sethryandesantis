# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion.**

1. Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Developer with [VIVA Physicians][0]
2. B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)
3. I am not book-smart, but code-smart
4. I do no re-invent, I extend of what is available and innovate
5. I love what I do, and I learned from one of the best, and continue to absorb information daily.
6. I focus on the details of what is happening behind the syntax.
7. Self-driven/motivatedI bring more to a team than being able to code; I don't speak to hear myself talk If I disagree I will provide an alternative approach.
