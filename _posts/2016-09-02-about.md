**This is not my job, it is my passion**Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer  
B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)

1. I code with an enterprise standards in mind no matter what the project

1. I'm used to working on large code-bases, and know how to approach them
2. I do **not **re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up
3. Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities
4. I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available and avoid the grunt work of memorizing and focus more on the overall design and structure
5. I learn best by doing, and absorbing knowledge from others
6. I bring much more than being a good developer to a team

**The non-coding part of me**

Huge fan of electronic music, and closely linked to the industry.   
Love LED's, especially Philips HUE.  
I enjoy fishing, but rarely catch anything.  
Strong love for animals, especially dogs.  
**Above all**  
I am fortunate that I have a supportive, amazing girlfriend who puts up with the ridiculous amount of LED's I have, and coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to develop software that will improve quality of life for those in need, and to give back more than ever.
