# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion.**

1. Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer with [VIVA Physicians][0]
2. B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)
3. I have been fortunate to work in several areas of the stack and languages, but I love it all
4. I do no re-invent, I extend off what is available and innovate.
5. At a certain point I stopped wondering how a piece of software was made, to knowing how it was done and how I could make it better.
6. Self-motivated, and self-driven to use the skills i have, and continue to develop to bring software that benefits well-being or quality of life
7. I will not develop for you if I don't believe in the ethics of the software, i.e. the micro transaction drain our users wallet approach is not what I am interested in.
8. I also will also not work in an environment where I cannot wear a nice pair or jeans and t-shirt to work.
9. I'm not book-smart, I am code-smart

I also am a big fan of hardware and building computers, snowboarding, dogs, and hockey.

Above all I am lucky to have a great girlfriend that puts up with me coding for days straight and having 12 Philips hue RGB lights in my room.
