# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion - I am not pursued by high offers from companies I do not support**

Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer  
B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)

* I am comfortable in Windows, MacOSX, and Linux (specific distros: Redhat/Ubuntu)

* I do not re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e., time/space complexity)

* Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better

I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available to my advantage, I spend the time planning/designing first to save time later. I think people that say I am intelligent take away the effort and time I put into better every day. I am only getting started. There is far more in this industry that I have yet to discover, the learning never stops, and that is the way I like it.

Fortunate that my father is a prodigy (he won't admit) and I continue to learn how to progress my skillset based on knowledge I have absorbed through-out my life, and it has propelled me far ahead of where I thought I'd be at this point.

## **Above all**

I am fortunate that I have an amazingly supportive girlfriend who puts up with the coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to use my passion to help others pursue theirs.
