# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion.**

1. Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Developer with [VIVA Physicians][0]
2. B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)
3. I am not book-smart, but code-smart.
4. My overall success and approach towards development are purely from absorbing every bit of knowledge I can from one of the best developers I know, my dad. 
5. I do no re-invent, I extend off what is available and innovate
6. At a certain point I stopped wondering how a piece of software was made, to knowing how it was done and how I could make it better.
7. Self-driven/motivated I bring more to a team than being able to code; I don't speak to hear myself talk If I disagree I will provide an alternative approach.
8. Although I thrive for the days where I can code all day and night, I am very easy going and relaxed
9. This isn't a career, I do not want to be a 9-5 programmer, I want to work my ass off and innovate
