# About

### **This is not my job, it is my passion.**

1. Currently: Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer
2. B.S. in Computer Science from Chapman University (2016)
3. Able to pick up languages, technology quickly, and understand it
4. I do not re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up 
5. Self-motivated/driven and confident in my abilities
6. I will not develop for a product I don't support or believe in 
7. I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available and avoid the grunt work of memorizing and focus more on the overall design and structure 
8. I learn best by doing, and absorbing knowledge from others
9. I bring much more than being a good developer to a team

**The non-coding part of me**

Huge fan of electronic music, and closely linked to the industry.   
Love LED's, especially Philips HUE.  
Avid sports fan, mostly Hockey.  
**Above all**  
I am fortunate that I have a supportive, amazing girlfriend who puts up with the ridiculous amount of LED's I have, and coding for multiple days straight. She has inspired me in a lot of ways to develop software that will improve quality of life for those in need, and to give back more than ever.
