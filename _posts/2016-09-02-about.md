# About

---

### Currently: 

* Full-Stack ASP.NET C\# Software Engineer @ VIVA Physicians
* Full-Stack Developer \[MEAN\] / Owner @ _ThinkFirst LLC_

### Education:

* B.S. Computer Science, Chapman University (2016)

### Action Items:

* Self-motivated/driven/taught and confident in my abilities to develop, but always pushing to become better
* I work with the hardware, not against it - (i.e., CPU Cache Lines)
* I do not re-invent, I extend off what is available and build up unless I have reasons otherwise (i.e., time/space complexity)

* I am comfortable in Windows, MacOSX, and Linux (specific distros: Redhat/Ubuntu)
* I am not book-smart, I am code-smart, I use the tools available to my advantage.
* I spend the time planning/designing first to save time later.

## **Personal Life**

I have a genuinely astounding girlfriend, who recognizes and supports my enthusiasm for coding and technology. 

She inspires me in a lot of ways to use my passion to assist others to continue theirs and give back as much as possible.

Always have music playing, avid snowboarder - Lake Tahoe will always be my second home. Squaw season pass holder, if not coding you'll find me there during the season.

I watch a lot of hockey.
